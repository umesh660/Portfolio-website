  </h4>
</li>
<p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14px;color:black;">
  • Developed an image classification model using Python in a Google Colab environment leveraging TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The project aimed to classify images into two categories: "Happy" and "Sad".
</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14px;color:black;">
  <li><b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Implemented data preprocessing steps including image extension validation and removal of unsupported image files. Ensured data integrity and compatibility for model training.</li>
  <li><b>Model Development:</b> Constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using Keras Sequential API. Designed the model with convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers to extract features and perform classification tasks effectively.</li>
  <li><b>Model Training:</b> Utilized TensorFlow's image dataset API to split the data into training, validation, and test sets. Trained the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. Monitored model performance on validation data to prevent overfitting.</li>
  <li><b>Model Evaluation:</b> Evaluated model performance metrics, including precision, recall, and binary accuracy, achieving a commendable accuracy of 93.5% on the test set.</li>
  <li><b>Prediction Demonstration:</b> Provided an example of model usage for making predictions on new images. Demonstrated the application of the trained model to classify images as "Happy" or "Sad" based on learned features.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14px;color:black;">
  • Outcome: Successfully developed an image classification model achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between "Happy" and "Sad" images. Contributed to advancing the understanding and application of deep learning techniques for image analysis tasks.
